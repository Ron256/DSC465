This repository houses all the home work projects for data visualization implemented in both R and Tableau.

Home Work Project 1 was about exploring the different visualizations for the Intel Stock, Perception Experiment, Infant data, and General Motors car price data sets.  

Home Work Project 2 was about exploring different visualizations for the US Food Services by county, Chicago crashes and Portland Water levels data sets where both R and Tableau were used to graph the different visualizations.  

Home Work Project 3 was about exploring different visualizations for the Perception Experiment, Astronomical, Montana Population, Air Quality and Student Skills Survey data sets.

The data set used for the Group project had multi-year US domestic flights from 2009 to 2018. We explored a variety of graphs starting with a flight destination density map that showed that most flights destinations located in California, the East Coast, the MidWest, Florida and the Gulf Coasts. Also, we employed two heat maps to visualize flight delays by both days and months.
