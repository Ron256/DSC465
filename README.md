This repository houses all the home work projects for data visualization implemented in both R and Tableau

The data set used for the Group project had multi-year US domestic flights from 2009 to 2018. We explored a variety of graphs starting with a flight destination density map that showed that most flights destinations located in California, the East Coast, the MidWest, Florida and the Gulf Coasts. Also, we employed two heat maps to visualize flight delays by both days and months.
